# Robin's Pokédex

This project is a Progressive Web App I created in order to gain more experience with React.

</br>

## Technologies used

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) as the main underlying JS Framework
- [React Context-API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) for State Management
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for Authentication and as the Database
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) as the Design Tool
- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) for styling and theming
- [framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for reliable animations in React
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) provides the icons used
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) as the Hosting Provider

## Lessons Learned

Taking the project from just a wish to work on something bigger than a landing page or school assignment to a working, installable PWA all by myself was an incredible experience.
Having full control over the features and technologies used, as well as being responsible for anything from the design to deployment makes the app really feel like my own.

React in conjunction with Firebase and styled-components create such an awesome development experience. Deploying with Netlify couldn't be easier and designing is actually fun when using Figma.
I learned a lot about all these technologies, as well as consuming REST-APIs and even some No-SQL data modelling with Firestore.

The project gave me the motivation to code every day and ignited the will in me to keep adding bigger and better apps to my personal portfolio.
